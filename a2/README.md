SLEEP HEALTH TRACKER

This program is designed to automatically collect sleep data from the user every day of the month 
and then generate the Average Deep Sleep, Average Core Sleep and Average REM Sleep data for the month. 
It appends the sleep data into a csv file called sleepdata.csv, which is saved in the a2 directory. 

We can use crontab -e to schedule this bash script to run every monring at a specified time, and 
serves as a reminder for the user to input the sleep data from their sleep monitors and track 
their sleep health data for improved sleep quality over time.
